In this program first we use library #include&lt;iostream&gt;
and math library #include&lt;cmath&gt;. After that we use
FUNCTIONS.

First, we define definition of function in which we declare
function for addition, subtraction, multiplication, divide,
power, modulus, square root, square, then algebraic
function, SIN, COS, TAN, LOG, ABSOLUTE. After that I use
MIX Operation to solve different operation. After that
sum conversion. Binary into decimal, octal, hexadecimal,
and Decimal into binary, octal, hexadecimal and Octal
into decimal and Hexadecimal into decimal.

Then in main first we declare n1, n2, and answer with
datatype double, m declare as integer, and func was
declare in char datatype. Then I give output mean (cout)
the whole operation with I have done in program. Then
we take input m (the operation which I want to do) .
Then I use while loop in which I give condition true in
which I use switch in which there is a case. These case
are doing a operation with I want to do. In every case
there is a use of function which was defined in the first of
the program. Then I saw wheather it wants to do another
operation or not. Then if I put ‘y’ this mean do a another
operation. Then if it was yes then it will call again in
main. If NO then it will exit.
